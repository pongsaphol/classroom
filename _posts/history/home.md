### Course Description

This course approaches the study of the past through the use of four distinct and interrelated disciplines: history, geography, economics, and civics. Skills from each sub-discipline will help students understand the topics, themes, places, and events that the course covers. Students will learn about civic ideals from Ancient China, Babylonia, and Greece. They will compare those ideas. They will see how Judaism, Christianity, and Islam spread in the ancient world and how that has affected the modern world. Students will learn about what allows empires to develop and what causes them to fall. Students will also read a book of history or historical fiction.
