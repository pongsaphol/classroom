### Big Geography 
- a term used to understand that history is not always local
- History tends to happen in large geographical regions
- Early humans knew this better than modern humans
- They experienced geography and climate on a daily basis
- Modern humans have technology and modern housing that aloow us to hide behind our relationship with geography and climate
- Diets, housing, art, religion, and social practices because of this

## Timeline

- 3.5 billion years ago, the first living organisms appered (tiny, but complex)
- 600 million years ago, the organism diversified and evolved into multicellular organsims
- Primates = large brains
- evolution of the genus homo in Africa
- 200,000 years ago, Homo sapiens evolved
  
### What makes humans different?
1. Powerful Brains
2. Development of symbolic language - the ability to learn collectively rather than individually

- The Cognitive Revolution began 70,000
- CR kickstarted history - History didn't exist before, only biology
- Homo Sapiens started to form elaborate structures called cultures


### Question
#### When did the first life appear on planet earth? 
  - 3.5 billion years ago.
#### Describe the first forms of life. 
  - Tiny but complex
#### What are the traits of our ancestors the Primates?
  - Large brain
#### When do humans appear?
  - 200,000 years ago
#### Why are humans important in terms of power?

#### What makes humans different?
  - Human have powerful brains and the ability to use language collectively.
#### What is Big Geography?
  - Big Geography is used to understand that history happens over large geographical areas.

## Paleolithic Era (2.6 million years ago - 12,000 years ago) $\rightarrow$ prehistoric human era
- Characterized by "Homo" using stone that has been purposefully prepared
- Called "Stone Age"
- Ended when bronze was used
- human live in hunter-gatherer bonds
- adapted new technologies and cultures to acclimate to the region they were in

### Pleistocene Epoch (2,588,000 years ago - 11,700 years ago)
- Characterized by cool episodes globally
- Called "Ice Ages"
- humans evolved 2.5 million years ago from the first apes (Australopithecus)
- left East Africa 
- due to different climates in these places, different traits were needed, so humans developed and evolved differently. 
- At least 6 other human species 
- Neanderthals - bulky and muscular & they settled in Europe / W.Asia $\rightarrow$ strong social relationships
- East Asia $\rightarrow$ Homo Erectus survived for 2 million years
#### What developed first: human anatomy or human culture? 
Answer: human anatomy developed first
#### The Cognitive Revolution
- 70,000 years ago
- sudden and random
- humans began to separate from other species (language)
1. humans could transmit larger amounts of information and could therefore carry out more complex actions
2. humans could transmit more information about social relationships and therefore could from larger communities
3. humans could transmit information about things that do not exist and therefore could could cooperate in large numbers which led to the rapid innovation of culture and society 
- ability to invent ficiton (religion, border ,nation, business) $\rightarrow$ creation of culture

#### Hunter-Gatherer Societies
How did the end of the Ice Age (Pleistocene Epoch) help change the climate and life for Homo Sapiens?
- 12,000 years ago > Ice Age ended
- temps of Earth began to warm
- ocean levels rose and shaped the continents as we know them today
- plant life flourished, animals
- life became easier for homo sapiens

#### benefits
Larger areas to live in > larger families > population grew
Domesticated dogs
Why were humans nomadic?
- went to the food supply
- signs of homo sapiens being sedentary where they could hunt/fish/gather in peace
- land disputes
- The Fertile Crescent in the Middle East - first permanent settlement (Mesopotamia)
- wild wheat and barley grow
- restricted by the Med. Sea and the Syrian Desert > settled

## Neolithic Era (10,000 years ago - 4,500 years ago)
Characterized by 
- fixed human settlements
- invention of agriculture
So
- led to new and more complex economic and social systems
  - Permanent settlements in Fertile Crescent / Mesopotamia, Nile River Valley, Indus River Valley, the Yellow River, Mesoamerica, Papua New Guinea, and the Andes
  - Pastoralism developed in Africa and Eurasia
  - Different crops and animals were domesticated > affected the diversity of local wildlife
  - Agricultural communities had to work cooperatively to clear land and create water systems for their crops. 
  - All of these practices drastically changed the environment and diversity of local wildlife > due to grazing of animals and clearing of land > led to the erosion of the land
- Transformations
  - Agriculturalism / pastoralism led to a more reliable and abundant food supply. 
  - Lead to a specialization of labor.
  - Technological innovations: pottery, plows, woven textiles, wheels
  - Elite groups accumulated wealth. Heirarchy and social structure

#### After the Ice Ages $\rightarrow$ human adapted to their new environment
- hunter gatherers
- agriculturalists
- pastoralists
Agricultural settlements around the world (Mesopotamia, the Nile River Valley, Indus River Valley, the Yellow River, Huang He Valley, Papua New Guinea, the Andes Mountains (Peru), Mesoamerica)
Switch to agriculture created a more reliable food supply
They did not have a diverse food supply compared to hunter gatherers.
#### Agricultural Societies had a massive impact on the environment:
- growing selected plants
- excluding other plants
- contructing irrigation systems (water systems)
- domesticating animals for food and labor
#### Results:
- larger population
- heirachy, social status
- forced labor systems (slavery)
- patriarchal societies

Pastoralists - people who domesticated and herded animal to different grazing ranges
Emerged in parts of Africa & Eurasia
Similar to agricultural societies, pastoral societies were also more socially stratified
Hunter gatherers $\rightarrow$ egalitarian societies (equal)
Pastoralists were mobile (moved from place to place) $\rightarrow$ interacted with settled populations $\rightarrow$ technological changes spread
Pastoralists $\rightarrow$ mobile $\rightarrow$ didn't accumulate many possessions

#### Genus homo (humans)
- homo sapiens
- homo neanderthalis
- homo erectus

#### What makes humans different? 
  - Powerful Brains and Development of symbolic language (the ability to learn collectively)
#### What is a genus and a species? 

### Period 2: The Cognitive Revolution 
#### What was the Cognitive Revolution? When did it begin? Why was it significant? 
  - It was the action that humans began to separate from other species. It began 70,000 years ago. The significant point of this revolution was its sudden and randomness.
#### How did humans live during the Paleolithic Era?
  - Humans live in hunter-gatherer bonds.
#### Where did humans migrate? Describe the migration patterns. 
  - Migrated from Africa to Eurasia, and then to America.
#### What other human species existed?
  - Homo Neanderthalensis and Homo Erectus
#### How did humans adapt their technology and culture to new climate regions? 
#### Which developed first: anatomy or culture?
  - Anatomy developed first 

### Period 3: The Neolithic Era and the Agricultural Revolution 
#### How did the change in climate affect Paleolithic and early neolithic human lifestyles? 
  - Ancient humans benefited from it by having more plants: many plants could grow well during the warmer temperature. 
#### What are the advantages of hunting and gathering? 
  - They had various food and not too much emploited natural resources.
#### What are the advantages of agriculture?
  - They have a reliable source of food, they don’t need to go outside and take a risk from danger. 
#### How did humans and human-made structures develop during the Neolithic Era?
#### What are pastoralists and how do they live?
  - People who domesticated and herded animals to different grazing ranges.
#### What are agriculturalists and how do they live?
  - Agriculturalists are the people who settled down and did farming, raising animals to be a food for living
#### Where did humans first settle and why? 
  - Around the Fertile Crescent because there were main streams like Trigris and Eupharates, so they had rich-fertile soil to grow plants. 
#### Why did humans transition from hunter gatherers to agricultural societies?
  - Because humans started to settle down in permanent places. They found the region which has rich resources to find.



### TED Talk (annotation, wrong grammar)
- skin related to climate
- collected data about earth surface
- img show ultra violate
- near the equator have higher UV
- skin pigment is the product of evolution
- previous theory is true
- early human evolve for UV = darkly pigment
- What happen?
- relationship to the earth surface UVB -> vitamin D
- Melanin is a natural sunscreen
- a billion year from this chemical
- folate help reproduction of the body
- then we moved
- major move outside equator, africa
- went to new world
- move to coller 
- get only UVA, but UVA is disappeared (winter)
- UVA have no vitamin D
- evolution -> lost their pigmentation to maximize vitamin D
