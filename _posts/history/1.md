The source of history

- Primary Source
  - Primary Source are original records produced by people at that time and they are original record
  - Example
    - Diary
    - Artifacts (Arrowheads, Heiroglyphics)
    - Architecture
    - Autobiography
    - Drawings
    - Speeches
    - Letter
    - Original Inventions
- Secondary Source
  - Secondary Sources are document, text, images that not present at that time. Usually person, such as, historian.
  - Example
    - Documentaries
    - Textbooks
    - Book/Research Papers
    - News

\* Documentaries are very bias, which means there are many opinions in this.

There are 3 examples which I would list below

1. I was watching ESPN and one of the reporters said he had heard good reviews about a new sports movie. When he talks about the movie, what is he?
   - Secondary Sources
2. I found a letter to one of my friends in the locker room after school the other day. I konw it's private, but I want to read it! What is the letter?
   - Secondary Sources
3. My friends and I found an old wedding dress in our attic. My father said it belonged to my grandmother. What is the dress?
   - Primary Sources

Then, I play Kahoot game.
