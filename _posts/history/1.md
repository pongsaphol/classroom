#### Why we study history?

- to know our past, to learn from the past
- to not repeat mistakes
- to understand your ancestors
- to plan for the future

#### What is history?

- History is an account of the past.
- Accounts differ depending on one's perspective.
- We rely on evidence to constuct accounts of the past.
- We must question the reliability of each piece of evidence.
- Any single piece of evidence is insufficient to build a plausible account.

### Class 2 H1112 (September 4, 2020)

[Link to Agenda](https://brewster.instructure.com/courses/812/pages/h1112-primary-vs-secondary-sources)

#### The source of history

The use of outside materials to give us information and evidence about a topic of study.

- Who wrote this?
- What is the author's perspective?
- What was it written?
- When was it written?
- Where was it written?
- Is it reliable? Why? Why not?

#### Primary Source

- A document or physical object that was written or created by someone during the time period being studied. An immediate or first hand account of an event.
- Example
  - Diary
  - Artifacts (Arrowheads, Heiroglyphics)
  - Architecture
  - Autobiography
  - Drawings
  - Speeches
  - Letter
  - Original Inventions

#### Secondary Source

- Information gathered by someone who did not take part in or witness an event.
- Example
  - Documentaries
  - Textbooks
  - Book/Research Papers
  - News

\* Documentaries are very bias, which means there are many opinions in this.

There are 3 examples which I would list below

1. I was watching ESPN and one of the reporters said he had heard good reviews about a new sports movie. When he talks about the movie, what is he?
   - Secondary Sources
2. I found a letter to one of my friends in the locker room after school the other day. I konw it's private, but I want to read it! What is the letter?
   - Secondary Sources
3. My friends and I found an old wedding dress in our attic. My father said it belonged to my grandmother. What is the dress?
