There are 3 examples which I would list below

1. I was watching ESPN and one of the reporters said he had heard good reviews about a new sports movie. When he talks about the movie, what is he?
   - Secondary Sources
2. I found a letter to one of my friends in the locker room after school the other day. I konw it's private, but I want to read it! What is the letter?

Topic: Early American History

Type: Primary

Title: Call to Rebellion

Author: Henry Highland Garnet

> The colonists threw the blame upon England. They said that the mother country entailed the evil upon them, and that they would rid themselves of it if they could. The world thought they were sincere, and the philanthropic pitied them. But time soon tested their sincerity.

Garnet, Henry Highland. “‘Call to Rebellion.’” African-American History, Facts On File,. Accessed 19 June 2020.

_Henry Highland Garnet says that the foundations of America were on slavery. In this quote, he points out that colonists blamed England for the acts of slavery and that there would be change if they were no longer connected to it. He goes on to point out that nothing changed when the colonies gained their independence. He is calling for black people who are enslaved to rebel._
