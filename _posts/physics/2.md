There are two equations showing below

The relation between $v$ and $a$

$\displaystyle\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}t} = a$

$\mathrm{d}v = a\,\mathrm{d}t$

$v = \displaystyle\int a\,\mathrm{d}t$

The relation between $x$ and $v$

$\displaystyle\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t} = v$

$\mathrm{d}x = v\,\mathrm{d}t$

$x = \displaystyle\int v\,\mathrm{d}t$
