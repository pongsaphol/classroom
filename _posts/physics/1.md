### Class 1 (September 2, 2020)

In first-class, we study in 1D dimension and there are some definition about this topic

1. $\vec{x}$ is displacement, which the distance that has a vector. The unit of this is $m$
2. $\vec{v}$ is velocity, this is the speed that has a direction. This can be defined by $\vec{v} = \frac{\Delta\vec{x}}{\Delta t}$ and you can use calculus to determine the velocity by $\vec{v} = \frac{d \vec{x}}{ d t}$. The unit of this is $m\cdot s^{-1}$
3. $\vec{a}$ is the acceleration of the object. It can be defined by $\vec{a} = \frac{d \vec{v}}{dt}$. The unit of this is $m\cdot s^{-2}$

After the definition, there are about 2 problems to solve in the class

### Class 2 (September 4, 2020)

Teacher teach about the motion of constant acceleration, then, she give some formula from graphes showing below

- $v = v_{0} + at$, you can determine this by ploting the graph

  - The slope of $x-t$ graph is the velocity and the slope of $a-t$ graph is the acceleration

  - If $a = 0$ the object move uniformly and the displacement will be $\vec{x} = \vec{v}_0 t$

- $\Delta x = v_0 \Delta t + \frac{1}{2} a \Delta t^2$

  - You can determine this equation by plotting the $v-t$ graph and find the area below the graph, which is the displacement

- $v^2 = v_0^2 + 2 a \Delta x$

  - This equation can be determined by combining the first and the second equation by algebra.

** Problem-solving strategy**

1. Draw a picture to virtualize what is happening

   1.1. Show the initial and final position

   1.2. Include the axis

Solving some problems

- $v=30 km/hr, v_0=45 km/hr, \Delta x = 250 m$ find $a, \Delta t$
