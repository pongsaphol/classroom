The ability to put something in its proper historical context-understanding an event or document in relation to what else was happening at the same time or in the same area. (Who? What? Where? When? Why?)

To contextualize an event historians try to answer these questions:

- When did it happen?
- Where did it happen?
- Where let to it?
- Why did it happen when and where it took place?
